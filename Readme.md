 ## Project Structure
 ```
 /src
â”‚â”€â”€ /controllers         # Business logic (User, Video, etc.)
â”‚â”€â”€ /models              # Mongoose models
â”‚â”€â”€ /routes              # API endpoints
â”‚â”€â”€ /middlewares         # Middleware functions (Auth, Multer, etc.)
â”‚â”€â”€ /utils               # Utility functions (Cloudinary, Helpers, etc.)
â”‚â”€â”€ server.js            # Main server entry point
â”‚â”€â”€ .env                 # Environment variables (ignored in Git)
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json         # Project dependencies

 
```

## File Upload Handling (Cloudinary + Multer)
- Multer temporarily stores uploaded files in `./public/temp.`
- Files are then uploaded to **Cloudinary** using the `uploadOnCloudinary()` function.
- Once uploaded, the local file is **deleted** to save space.
